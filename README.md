### Linux 
Requirements: A basic understanding of how to use a terminal emulator, and access to root privileges.  
> All of the following commands assume a Ubuntu-based distribution using the `bash` shell. Your experience may vary.

### Initial setup
You should only have to do the following one time, when first setting up the project.

1. Clone the repository (you may need to install `git` via your package manager)
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/kd8lvt/PokeBounce.git
> cd PokeBounce
> ```
2. Run the `install` script
> ```bash
> sudo ./install
> ```

### Updating
---
If you want to update the project to the latest codebase, simply run the `update` script
```bash
./update
```
---
### Running
Run the `run` script :)
```bash
./run
```
If you want to update the project before running it, you can do so without the `./update` script.
```bash
./run -u
```
