# TODO

## General

- [ ] Registries!!  

- [ ] Randomized spawn locations  

- [ ] Less janky sprite loading (fully automatic, ideally)

## Scripts

- [ ] Isolate the privilege escalation, asking for sudo password only once the apt command is run.
- [ ] Add a `PYTHON` variable.
- [ ] Add Windows and / or other distribution support.

## Config System

- [ ] A simple config file to load the same things currently being stored in Python.
- [ ] Allowing the end user to select the Pokemon, and / or their positions in the battle.
